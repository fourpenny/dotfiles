# dotfiles
My dotfiles in .config. Run the setup script (setup.bash) to get everything setup nicely.

## General Instructions
To call the install script, make sure you can run the file:
`chmod u+x ./setup.bash`

If you would like to install the i3 wm when running the install script, make sure to include the appropriate flag:
`./setup.bash --i3`

After installing, make sure you run vim-plug in Neovim with the command `:PlugInstall`.
